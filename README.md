# Big O Assessment

 ### O Boy! It's time to evaluate your understanding of Big O Notation!

 ##

  PART ONE: Please answer the following questions:

 1. Describe the purpose of Big 0.

    The purpose of big O is to help measure the complexity of algorithms.

 2. What 2 things does it measure?

    Runtime and Space requirements

---


 3. Which of the following shows Big O time complexity in order?

    a) O(1), O(n log n), O(log n), O(n), O(n^2)

    b) O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2)

    c) O(1), O(log n), O(n log n), O(n), O(n^2)

    > Answer here

    B

4. Which of these algorithm(s) run in O(log n) time?

   Binary Search

   Bubble Sort

   Quick Sort (average case)

   Linear Search

   > Answer here

   Binary Search

5. Select the best time complexity that even the most efficient sort algorithm can have.

    O(log n)

    O(n log n)

    O(n)

    O(n^2)

    > Answer here

    O(n log n)

 6. Describe what sets these these 3 complexities apart from each other: O(1), O(n) and O(n^2)

    > Answer here

    For O(1), we know that as the number of items change the complexity stays the same(constant complexity), for O(n) the number of items and the complexity change at the same rate(Linear complexity), O(n^2) is more similar to O(n) in that both number of items and complexity change, however, with 0(n^2) the complexity increases at a much higher rate than number of items making it the slowest/most complex(Quadratic complexity).

7. How would you recognize O(log n) and O(n log n) time complexities in a function?

    > Answer here

    O(log n) in a function would require one step ahead of that to get O(n). This would typically be to sort data. O(n log n) does not need an extra step.
